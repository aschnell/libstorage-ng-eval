/**
 * Utility class to read and write config files that might contain comments.
 * This class tries to preserve any existing comments and keep them together
 * with the content line immediately following them.
 *
 * This class supports the notion of a header comment block, a footer comment
 * block, a comment block preceding any content line and a line comment on the
 * content line itself.
 *
 * A comment preceding a content line is stored together with the content line,
 * so moving around entries in the file will keep the comment with the content
 * line it belongs to.
 *
 * The default comment marker is '#' like in most Linux config files, but it
 * can be set with setCommentMarker().
 *
 * Example (line numbers added for easier reference):
 *
 *   001    # Header comment 1
 *   002    # Header comment 2
 *   003    # Header comment 3
 *   004
 *   005
 *   006    # Header comment 4
 *   007    # Header comment 5
 *   008
 *   009    # Content line 1 comment 1
 *   010    # Content line 1 comment 2
 *   011    content line 1
 *   012    content line 2
 *   013
 *   014    content line 3
 *   015
 *   016    content line 4
 *   017    content line 5 # Line comment 5
 *   018    # Content line 6 comment 1
 *   019
 *   020    content line 6 # Line comment 6
 *   021    content line 7
 *   022
 *   023    # Footer comment 1
 *   024    # Footer comment 2
 *   025
 *   026    # Footer comment 3
 *
 *
 * Empty lines or lines that have only whitespace belong to the next comment
 * block: The footer comment consists of lines 022..026.
 *
 * The only exception is the header comment that stretches from the start of
 * the file to the last empty line preceding a content line. This is what
 * separates the header comment from the comment that belongs to the first
 * content line. In this example, the header comment consists of lines
 * 001..008.
 *
 * Content line 1 in line 011 has comments 009..010.
 * Content line 2 in line 012 has no comment.
 * Content line 3 in line 014 has comment 013 (an empty line).
 * Content line 5 in line 017 has a line comment "# Line comment 5".
 * Content line 6 in line 020 has comments 018..019 and a line comment.
 *
 * Applications using this class can largely just ignore all the comment stuff;
 * the class will handle the comments automagically.
