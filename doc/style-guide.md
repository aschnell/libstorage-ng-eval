Style Guide
===========


Class names should normally use the CapWords convention.

Function names should be lowercase with words separated by underscores.

The auto keyword should be avoided.

C++11, C++14 and C++17 features can be used when the tool-chain for all
supported distributions provides them.


For API functions it must be avoided to modify parameters and use them as
return values since this is not always obvious for API users and difficult to
support in some target languages.



Conventions
===========

Functions used in the text() or commit() functions of Action XX should be
called do_xx_text() and do_xx(). E.g. the Mount action uses
Filesystem.do_mount() and Filesystem.do_mount_text(). No other functions
should have that naming schema.

When variables or values with an underscores in the name are written to XML
the underscores have to be replaced by dashed. So e.g. chunk_size is saved as
<chunk-size>16384</chunk-size>. In the logs the names should follow the same
convention.
